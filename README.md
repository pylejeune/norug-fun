## Context & Vision

- **Context**: The DeFi sector is rapidly evolving, but issues with transparency, security, and innovation still persist. Investors are looking for reliable, transparent solutions with innovative ways to earn.

- **Vision**: Build a platform on Solana with two phases:
  1. **Phase 1**: Test and community engagement through a token proposal interface ("be the dev").
  2. **Phase 2**: Launch the most successful projects through a pool, similar to Meteora.

## Features

- **Vault and Epoch Management**: A vault stores SOL invested in Phase 1. A smart contract manages the opening and closing of epochs and the distribution of funds based on proposal success.
- **Launch Pool (Phase 2)**: The top-performing projects from Phase 1 are launched via a pool, where tokens are allocated and distributed to initial investors.

- **Modularity**: The architecture is modular, allowing additional features to be added without impacting the core system.

- **Front-End APIs and Integrations**: Secure APIs connect the front-end to the smart contracts.

- **Monitoring and Reporting**: Real-time tools track transactions, fundraising progress, and pool performance.

- **User Experience**: Intuitive interface with crypto wallet integrations (Phantom, Solflare) and interactive dashboards for tracking epochs, vaults, and pools.

- **Specific Features**:
  - Dedicated pages for token proposals ("be the dev"/"founder window").
  - Investment tracking, real-time alerts, and notifications.
