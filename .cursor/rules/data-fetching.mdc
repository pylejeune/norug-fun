# Data Fetching

- Use **SWR** or **React Query** for client-side data fetching.
- Prefer fetching data in **Server Components** to leverage SSR (Server-Side Rendering).
- Use custom hooks for data fetching logic to maintain consistency across the app.
- Avoid direct API calls inside presentational components; use server actions for any server-side logic.
