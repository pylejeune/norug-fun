# Security

- Always **validate and sanitize** data coming from the user.
- Use **secure environments** for storing secrets (e.g., `.env` files).
- Implement measures to prevent XSS, CSRF, and SQL injection attacks in the backend.
- For Solana interactions, ensure **transactions are properly signed** and validate instructions on the backend.
