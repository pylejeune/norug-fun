# Solana Programs with Anchor

- Use **Anchor** to develop Solana programs.
- Separate instruction logic into the `instructions/` folder, and keep `state.rs` centralized for all state management.
- Each program should have explicit error handling in `error.rs`.
- Add unit tests for each instruction in the `/tests/` folder.
